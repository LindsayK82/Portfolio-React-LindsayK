# <Lindsay's Portfolio>

## Description

This site was created as a means to condense all of my prjects into one easy site to browse. I wanted a user to have a simple experience on my site, and built the page with React to provide it!


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To run the app from the backend:

-run command npm install
-run command npm start

## Usage

The site is built to be a one page scrolling site. Starting at the top is the introduction, the next scroll brings you to the About Me, then the Portfolio links, and finally a contact page that sends a contact to my personal email.
